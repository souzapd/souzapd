I am an analytics specialist and industrial engineer with seven years of experience enabling decision-making in operations across Energy, Education, and Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industries. I am skilled in analytics engineering, applied statistics, data visualisation, and continuous improvement.

In my current role at Pearson, I lead data stewardship and governance for international markets, building pipelines and dashboards for non-technical teams to assess product data quality.

In previous roles, I have focused on improving analytics infrastructure and processes. I delivered a change-detection system that processes 15,000 SKUs/minute for forecast reviews; streamlined queries to reduce the runtime by 90%; implemented data quality monitoring that pre-empted ~2,000 support tickets; automated reporting processes to simplify KPI tracking; ported forecasting models to enable hydropower operations planning; and spearheaded kaizen initiatives across business processes.

Tools and technologies I use:
- Methods: ANOVA, Linear mixed models, Resampling methods, Time series
- Programming: SQL, R, Python, D3.js
- Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, statsmodels, scikit-learn, lme4, emmeans
- Data platforms: BigQuery, Databricks, Alteryx, Tableau
