Analytics specialist with seven years of experience designing analytics systems for business operations across Energy, Education, and Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industries. I specialise in applied statistics, analytics engineering, and operations management.

At Pearson, I lead data stewardship and governance for international markets, building pipelines and dashboards to allow business teams to assess product data quality.

In previous roles, I improved analytics infrastructure and processes. I delivered a change-detection system that processes 15,000 SKUs/minute for forecast reviews; streamlined queries to reduce the runtime by 90%; implemented data quality monitoring that pre-empted ~2,000 support tickets over six months; automated reporting processes to simplify KPI tracking; ported forecasting models to enable hydropower operations planning; and spearheaded kaizen initiatives across business processes.

Tools and technologies I use:
- Methods: ANOVA, Linear mixed models, Resampling methods, Time series
- Programming: SQL, R, Python, Julia, D3.js
- Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, statsmodels, scikit-learn, lme4, emmeans
