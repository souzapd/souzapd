I am an analytics specialist with six years of experience supporting decision-making in operations across Energy, Education, and Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industries. I am skilled in analytics engineering, applied statistics, data visualisation, and continuous improvement. I have a background in Industrial Engineering, specialising in operations planning. I am a dual national of Brazil and Portugal.

This expertise allows me to translate the needs of business teams into data products. I have worked with international teams, collaborating with colleagues in Brazil, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and India to deliver data solutions.

In previous roles, I have built a change-detection system processing 15,000 SKUs/minute to facilitate forecast reviews; streamlined queries to reduce the processing runtime by 90%; implemented data quality monitoring that pre-empted ~2,000 support tickets; ported forecasting models to enable hydropower operations planning; automated reporting processes to simplify KPI tracking; and spearheaded continuous improvement initiatives across business processes.

In my current role at Pearson, I lead efforts around data stewardship and governance, and build pipelines to support product data quality for international teams.

Tools and technologies I use:
- Methods: ANOVA, Linear mixed models, Marginal effects, Time series analysis, Six Sigma
- Programming: SQL, R, Python, D3.js
- Data platforms: PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Databricks, Alteryx, Tableau
